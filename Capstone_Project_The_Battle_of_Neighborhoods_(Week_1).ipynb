        "Toronto is Canada's largest city and the capital of the province of Ontario. It's a dynamic metropolis with a core of soaring skyscrapers, all dwarfed by the iconic, free-standing CN Tower. This capstone project aims to explore neighborhoods in Toronto, including Central Toronto, East Toronto, West Toronto, and Downtown Toronto. Many people migrate to Canada every year from around the world. Toronto is one of the most desired cities for them. The aim is to help people to explore better facilities around the neighborhoods of Toronto. It will help newcomers access cafes, schools, supermarkets, medical shops, grocery shops, malls, theatres, hospitals, etc. Our findings will help immigrants make informed decisions and address any concerns they have, including the different kinds of cuisines, pubs, parks, provision stores, and what the city has to offer. It will help people make smart and efficient decisions on selecting great neighborhoods out of numbers of other Toronto neighborhoods.\r\n",

The foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.
